Question :-  What is the Functional interface?
The interface who contain only one abstract method 
but can have multiple default and static method is called functional interface

i.e
Runnable   	=  run()
Callable 	= call()
Comparable	= compareTo()
Comprator	= compare()


Question:- What is the Stream API?

-> Stream API is used to process collections of objects;
-> A stream a sequence of of object that supports various methods which can be pipelined 
   to produce the desire result.
-> A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from  the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.
-> Stream does not change the original data structure they only provide the result as per the pipelined method.

Question :- Why we need stream API?
1- Functional Programming
2- Code Reduce
3- Bulk Operation

filter() method = use for conditional check
forEach - for iteration
